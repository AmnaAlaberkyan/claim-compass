## How It Works

```
📸 Photo → 🔍 Quality Gate → 🔬 Damage Detection → 📍 Localization → 🚦 Smart Routing → 👤 Human Verification → ✅ Done
```

**Three AI agents** (Gemini 2.5 Flash + Pro) assess damage in under 60 seconds. **Configurable rules** route claims to approve, review, or escalate. **Adjusters verify, reject, or edit**—every action logged, every correction becomes training data.

- **Adjusters:** Bounding box evidence • One-click decisions with reason codes  
- **Ops:** Tune thresholds at `/controls` without code changes
